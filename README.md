# GlowDuino - IoT Weather Station
A basic IoT weather station based on the GlowDuino Uno microcontroller board.

## Used Components for now
Microcontroller:
GlowDuino Uno: [www.glowduino.com](https://www.glowduino.com/)
Temperature-humidity:
DHT12: [www.amazon.com](https://amz.run/6RyK)
Pressure-temperature:
BMP-280: [www.amazon.com](https://amz.run/6RyH)
Internet connection and data storage:
SunFounder Ethernet shield: [www.amazon.com](https://amz.run/6RyV)

## Goals for the project
- Measure basic atmospheric properties: temperature, humidity, pressure
- Simple web interface to display raw values
- Approximate weather forecast based on measured values
- Data logging for trend analysis
